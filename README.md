# toggle_trackpad.sh

A simple bash script that toggles the touchpad in a given GNOME environment. To run, execute the following in bash:

```bash
.\toggle_trackpad.sh
```

That's it!

You may wish to add this functionality as a shortcut in Fedora with GNOME. To do that, go to Settings > Keyboard > View and Customize Shortcuts > Custom Shortcuts, then add a shortcut with the Command set to this shell script. Assign it to a key combination and you are good to go!
